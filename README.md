## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript - for email validation and submission

### What I learned

- This challenge was a simple one but managed to challenge the core concepts of web development.
- I got a proper opportunity to use grid and flexbox in the same project and it gave me an idea of when to use which.

### Continued development

- I wanted to use API to validate email but used simple regex instead as the challenge did not demand it.
- I am looking forward to get more familiar with DOM manipulation in plain JS.
